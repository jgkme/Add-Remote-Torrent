**Add Remote Torrent does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

All the information you provide, such as server configurations (including server names, URLs, usernames, and passwords), is stored locally on your computer using the `chrome.storage.local` API. This data is never sent to any external servers or third parties. It remains entirely under your control within your browser's local storage.

## 3. Permissions

The Extension requests the following permissions to provide its functionality:

*   **storage:** To save your server configurations locally on your device.
*   **contextMenus:** To provide the right-click context menu for adding torrents.
*   **notifications:** To display success or failure notifications after an action is performed.
*   **offscreen:** To play audio notifications for success or failure.
*   **optional_host_permissions:** To communicate with the torrent client servers that you configure. These permissions are only requested for the specific URLs you provide in the extension's options and are necessary for the extension to function.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party services for data collection or analytics. All communication happens directly between your browser and the torrent client servers you have configured.
