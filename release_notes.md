**Fix:** Implemented a comprehensive fix for uTorrent connectivity. The handler now correctly uses a user-configurable "Relative Path" for all API requests (including token fetching and connection testing), resolving errors for non-standard WebUI paths. The connection test now uses a more reliable `getsettings` check.
**UX:** The options page now auto-detects and separates the relative path if it's included in the main server URL for uTorrent clients, and the "Open WebUI" button correctly constructs the URL using this path.
