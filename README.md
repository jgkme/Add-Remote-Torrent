# Add Remote Torrent

A Chrome browser extension that allows users to easily add torrents (via magnet links or .torrent file URLs) to various remote torrent client WebUIs. It supports managing multiple server profiles for different client types like qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, and more, offering a streamlined experience for torrent management directly from your browser.

I used Cline + Google Gemini Pro to code this from scratch losely based on now discontinued @bogenpirat/remote-torrent-adder with my own added features.
Please give it a try and create some feedbacks or issues here.

### Adding Torrents with a Single Click (On-Page Catching)

The extension can automatically detect torrent links on any webpage and allow you to add them with a single left-click, without needing to use the right-click context menu.

**How to Enable:**

1.  Open the extension's **Options** page.
2.  Go to the **"Other Global Settings"** section.
3.  Check the box next to **"Enable on-page link/form catching"**.

Once enabled, the extension will monitor pages for torrent links (like `magnet:` or links ending in `.torrent`). When you click one of these links, it will be automatically sent to your configured torrent client.

#### **Catching links that don't end in `.torrent`**
Some websites provide download links for `.torrent` files that don't have the `.torrent` file extension in the URL (e.g., `https://example.com/download.php?id=123`). By default, the extension won't catch these.

To catch these links, you need to add a custom URL pattern:
1.  Go to the extension's **Options** page -> **Other Global Settings**.
2.  Find the **"Custom URL patterns for on-page link catching"** text box.
3.  Enter a unique part of the URL for that website's torrent links. You can separate multiple patterns with a tilde (`~`).

**Example:** If a site's download links look like `https://www.example-tracker.com/torrent.php/12345/my-file.torrent`, a good pattern to add would be `example-tracker.com/torrent.php/`.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: Why does Chrome show a warning about "Enhanced Protection" when I install the extension?**
A: Chrome's Enhanced Safe Browsing shows this warning for new extensions or extensions from new developers. To become "trusted," a developer must follow the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies for a few months. Our extension is fully compliant with these policies, including a strict privacy policy and the use of minimal permissions. Your security is a top priority.

**Q: I'm having trouble connecting to my client, especially with qBittorrent v4.3.0+ or ruTorrent.**
A:
*   **qBittorrent:** For versions 4.3.0 and newer (especially v5.1.0+), you may need to disable "CSRF Protection" in the WebUI options under the "Web UI" tab. Our extension needs to interact with the API in a way that can be blocked by this feature.
*   **ruTorrent:** For the best results, enter the full URL to your ruTorrent installation in the **"Server URL"** field (e.g., `https://your-server.com/rutorrent`) and leave the **"ruTorrent Relative Path"** field blank. Alternatively, you can enter the base URL (e.g., `https://your-server.com`) and the path (e.g., `/rutorrent`) in their respective fields.

**Q: A torrent link didn't get added correctly.**
A: Some websites use intermediate links or redirects. The extension tries to follow these, but it may not always succeed. If a link fails, try right-clicking and using the "Add Torrent to Remote WebUI" context menu option. If the problem persists, please open an issue on GitHub with the details.

**Q: I'm using an old version of uTorrent (like v2.0.4) and getting a "Failed to obtain uTorrent CSRF token" error.**
A: Very old versions of the uTorrent WebUI have a different API. When you configure your server in the extension's options, make sure you select **"uTorrent (Old)"** as the "Client Type". This uses a legacy API handler that is compatible with older clients. If you have selected the standard "uTorrent" client type, it will fail with a token error.

**Q: On macOS, clicking torrent links doesn't do anything.**
A: Please ensure that the "Enable on-page link/form catching" option is enabled in the extension's settings. You can find this under "Other Global Settings" on the options page. If it is enabled and still not working, please open an issue on GitHub and provide as much detail as possible, including your macOS and Chrome versions.

**Q: I'm having trouble connecting to rTorrent on seedbox.io.**
A: For older `seedbox.io` accounts, you may need a specific URL format. When configuring the `rTorrent (XML-RPC)` client, try the following:
*   **rTorrent Web UI URL:** `https://<full_username>.seedbox.io/`
*   **SCGI/HTTPRPC URL (for rTorrent):** `https://<full_username>.seedbox.io/RPC/<username_numbers_only>/`

**Q: As a developer, I see a lot of console messages from this extension. Can it be disabled?**
A: Yes. The extension uses a `MutationObserver` to detect dynamically added links, which can be verbose. You can disable this logging without losing functionality.
*   Go to the extension's **Options** page.
*   At the bottom, find the **"Debug & Log Settings"** section.
*   Uncheck the boxes for "content-script" to disable the on-page console messages.

    *   **Fix:** Corrected a critical bug where the "context invalidated" error would spam the console on pages with dynamic content. The content script now handles this error gracefully.
    *   **Fix:** Improved the `LinkMonitor` to more reliably detect torrent links on dynamic web pages (e.g., Telegram, Facebook) by re-scanning sections of the page when significant changes are detected.
    *   **Fix:** Added the `dashboard` directory to the build process, resolving an `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` error when trying to access the new Dashboard page.
*   **v0.4.3 (2025-09-10):**
    *   **Fix:** Added the missing "alarms" permission to the manifest file, which was causing the service worker to fail and preventing the periodic server status check from running.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected a data-loss bug where editing and saving an existing server profile would unintentionally erase its stored status information (version, free space, online status).
*   **v0.4.0 (2025-09-10):**
    *   **Feature: Dashboard Page:** Added a new Dashboard page accessible from the popup, which displays the online/offline status of all servers, advanced client information (version, free space), and a log of the last 10 actions.
    *   **Feature: Advanced Connection Testing:** The "Test Connection" feature now fetches and displays the client version and free disk space for qBittorrent, Transmission, and Deluge servers.
    *   **Feature: Client-Specific Advanced Options:** Added a "Content Layout" dropdown in the "Confirm Add" dialog for qBittorrent, a "Bandwidth Priority" option for Transmission, and a "Move when Completed" option for Deluge, which appear contextually based on the target client.
    *   **Feature: UI/UX Enhancements:**
        *   Added client-specific setup hints to the options page.
        *   Added instructional text for Tags, Categories, and Directories to guide users.

    *   **Fix:** Resolved a UI bug where the "Confirm Add" dialog would sometimes show a scrollbar on different screen sizes or scaling settings.
    *   **Chore:** Updated project dependencies to the latest versions.
*   **v0.3.21 (2025-09-06):**
    *   **Fix:** Resolved a critical "Extension context invalidated" error that occurred during extension reloads. The content script now handles this expected error gracefully, preventing console errors on every page load and improving overall stability.
*   **v0.3.20 (2025-09-06):**
    *   **Fix:** Corrected a regression where the "URL-to-Server Mappings" feature was being ignored. The server selection logic now correctly prioritizes URL-based rules over context menu selections, restoring the expected automatic routing behavior.
*   **v0.3.19 (2025-09-05):**
    *   **Feature:** Overhauled the "Custom Link Catching Patterns" setting. It now features a user-friendly UI for adding, editing, and deleting individual regex patterns, replacing the old, single-string input.
    *   **Feature:** Added two default patterns to catch common `.torrent` file links and `torrents.php` download links, improving out-of-the-box functionality.
    *   **Migration:** Implemented a seamless, one-time migration for existing users. The old `linkmatches` tilde-separated string is automatically converted into the new array-based format, preserving all user-defined patterns.
*   **v0.3.18 (2025-09-05):**
    *   **Feature:** Added support for four new clients: BiglyBT, Flood, Porla, and an updated Elementum handler.
    *   **Feature:** Added a new option to show download directories in the context menu. This allows for adding torrents to specific directories in one click.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected a bug where the context menu would fail to update if a server had no download directories defined.
    *   **Fix:** Added error handling to the content script to prevent "context invalidated" errors on dynamic pages.
*   **v0.3.17 (2025-08-29):**
    *   **Fix:** Implemented a comprehensive fix for uTorrent connectivity. The handler now correctly uses a user-configurable "Relative Path" for all API requests (including token fetching and connection testing), resolving errors for non-standard WebUI paths. The connection test now uses a more reliable `getsettings` check.
    *   **UX:** The options page now auto-detects and separates the relative path if it's included in the main server URL for uTorrent clients, and the "Open WebUI" button in both the options page and the popup correctly constructs the URL using this path.
*   **v0.3.11 (2025-08-19):**
    *   **Feature:** Added an accessibility option to enable/disable text-based (visual) notifications for success or failure, providing an alternative to sound-based feedback.
*   **v0.3.10 (2025-08-18):**
    *   **Security:** Fixed multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the options page where user-provided data was not properly sanitized before being rendered. This hardens the extension against malicious data injection in the URL mapping and tracker rules lists.
*   **v0.3.9 (2025-08-18):**
    *   **Fixed:** Resolved an issue where torrent links on a page were not being detected or intercepted due to a `ReferenceError` in the content script. On-page link catching should now work correctly again.
*   **v0.3.8 (2025-08-16):**
    *   **Feature:** Added the ability to specify a list of download directories per server and select one from a dropdown in the "Add Torrent" dialog.
*   **v0.3.7 (2025-08-15):**
    *   **Fixed:**
        *   **ruTorrent:** Improved torrent file handling by always attempting to download the `.torrent` file content, even with incorrect `Content-Type` headers. This resolves upload issues with clients like ruTorrent that cannot access torrent URLs directly.
        *   **Notifications:** Corrected all error notification titles to `Add Remote Torrent Error`.
*   **v0.3.6 (2025-08-14):**
    *   **Feature:** Added a "Report Issue" button in the popup to streamline bug reporting.
    *   **Fixed:**
        *   **ruTorrent:** Corrected URL construction logic to prevent 404 errors.
        *   **uTorrent (Old):** Modified the API handler to support very old, token-less clients.
    *   **Docs:**
        *   Added a "Reporting Issues" section to the README with instructions for debugging.
        *   Updated troubleshooting guide for ruTorrent and old uTorrent versions.
*   **v0.3.5 (2025-08-13):**
    *   **Fixed:**
        *   **ruTorrent:** Corrected an issue where the server URL was not being constructed properly, causing connection failures.
        *   **uTorrent:** Added a new "uTorrent (Old)" client type to support older versions of the uTorrent WebUI (e.g., v2.0.4) that do not support modern API features like setting labels or download directories.
*   **v0.3.4 (2025-08-13):**
    *   **Added:**
        *   **WebUI Link:** The "Active Server Details" section in the popup is now a clickable link that opens the server's WebUI.
    *   **Improved:**
        *   **Dependencies:** Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions.
        *   **Documentation:** Updated the README with a more compliant overview, a link to the Chrome Web Store, and a new Troubleshooting/FAQ section.
*   **v0.3.3 (2025-08-13):**
    *   **Added:**
        *   **New Clients:** Added support for Hadouken, Tixati, Torrentflux, Vuze (HTML WebUI), Flood, Tribler, and BiglyBT.
    *   **Fixed:**
        *   **ruTorrent:** Corrected the handler to properly add torrents, addressing issues with URL construction, magnet link handling, and parameter submission based on official documentation and community implementations.
