# Progress: Add Remote Torrent

## 1. Current Project Status

-   **Overall:** A critical hotfix (v0.4.8) has been developed to address major bugs from the v0.4.7 release.
-   **Current Activity:** Finalizing documentation before releasing the hotfix.

## 2. Phased Implementation Plan

---
### **Phase 0: Original qBittorrent WebUI Adder (Completed)**
*Objective: Develop a fully-featured Chrome extension for adding torrents to qBittorrent servers.*
-   **Status:** [X] Completed.

---
### **Phase 1: Multi-Client Architecture Transformation (Completed)**
*Objective: Transform the existing extension into a multi-client torrent adder by refactoring the core architecture.*
-   **Status:** [X] Completed.

---
### **Phase 2: Expanded Client Support & UX Refinements (Completed)**
*Objective: Expand client compatibility and refine the user experience with major new features.*
-   **Status:** [X] Completed.

---
### **Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements & System Modernization (Completed)**
*Objective: Modernize core features with better UI and robust, future-proof logic.*
-   **Status:** [X] Completed.

---
### **Phase 4: Stability & Hotfixes (In Progress)**
*Objective: Address critical bugs and improve the stability of existing features.*

-   **Release v0.4.8 (Current Hotfix):**
    -   [X] **Fix (Critical):** Overhauled the download completion notification system to prevent notification spam. The system now only tracks and notifies for torrents added *by the extension*, ignoring the user's wider torrent list.
    -   [X] **Fix:** Resolved a bug where qBittorrent servers would display "N/A" for total torrents and speed statistics in the popup and dashboard.
    -   [X] **Feature:** Added a global setting in the Options page to allow users to enable or disable download completion notifications, providing full control over the feature.
    -   [X] **Refactor:** Established a new `getTorrentsInfo(serverConfig, hashes)` function as a required standard for API handlers to support the new targeted notification system.

---
### **Phase 5: Advanced Features & Polish (Future)**
*Objective: Introduce advanced client-specific options and further polish the overall extension.*
-   [ ] Consider client-specific advanced options in the "Advanced Add Dialog".
-   [ ] Further UI/UX improvements based on multi-client usage patterns and feedback.

## 3. Known Issues & Blockers
-   **Low Priority:** The new `trackedTorrents` list does not currently handle cases where a torrent is deleted from the client before completing. This is a minor edge case and can be addressed later.
-   **Placeholder Handler Functionality:** Many existing handlers (e.g., Buffalo, tTorrent) are still very basic and require significant work to become fully functional.
-   **rTorrent Handler XML Complexity:** The rTorrent handler could be made more robust.
